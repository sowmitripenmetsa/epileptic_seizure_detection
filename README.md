# epileptic_seizure_detection
Epileptic seizures are a significant neurological disorder affecting millions worldwide. Traditionally, seizure detection has relied on manual analysis of EEG recordings by clinicians. Developing a model that enables timely medical intervention, potentially saving lives by detecting seizures early. This improves the quality of life for patients by allowing better management of their condition. This paper proposes hybrid models and ensembling methods. We propose a system architecture using machine learning and deep learning models with the accuracy of 97.96% to analyze EEG signals. This proposed system works for short-scale data and large-scale data. The system provides continuous monitoring and real-time detection of seizures. This project not only enhances patient outcomes but also contributes to the advancement of medical technology and the understanding of neurological disorders.

OBJECTIVE:
To analyze EEG data for patterns indicative of epileptic seizures.
To develop and train deep learning models for accurate seizure detection.
To evaluate the performance of these models using standard metrics.
To create a real-time system for monitoring and detecting seizures, improving clinical outcomes for epilepsy patients.
